**Overview**

Crash Lab is an interactive 2D car-collision simulation built using JavaFX, structured with MVC, and powered by a custom Newtonian Physics Engine.
The application allows users to:

-> Select different vehicles

-> Adjust speed, mass, and angle

-> Run a head-on collision simulation with animations

--- View calculated physics results ---

-> Momentum

-> Kinetic energy

-> Impact force

-> Energy loss %

-> Damage % for each vehicle

The project includes:

Full JavaFX UI with multiple screens (Title Screen, Instructions, Simulation View)

Realistic animation timing based on user input

Physics engine using Newtonian mechanics

JUnit tests (Physics engine + collision calculations)

Structured, easy-to-read code following best practices
